                    <hr>
                    <p>Ryann has been doing my hair for over 10 years. Her work is always amazing.
                        Her dye jobs are always great and I love her cuts. Just recently she cut 
                        almost 7 inches off my hair and gave me a totally new short style I love.
                        I know Ryann has a loyal following of many happy customers and she deserves it.
                        Hands down my favorite stylist.

                    <p>I love that Ryann comes to my home to do my hair, which makes it super convenient.
                        She gives a great cut and she does a great job with blonde highlights. I would
                        definitely reccomend her.

                    <p>I've been getting my hair cut, colored, highlighted, touched up, and styled by Ryann
                        for over 20 years now, and I'll probbaly continue using her services for another 20. She 
                        gives great hair care advice, so thanks to her, my hair has always been in perfect 
                        condition. There is no one else like her.
