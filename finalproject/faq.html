                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p>Curious about something? Chances are, your question has already been asked.<br>
                All questions answered by Ryann herself.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-main">
                <h3>Do I need to have anything ready before the appointment?</h3>
                <p>No. I bring everything needed including products, towels, and everything else. The only thing I need from you is a chair for you to sit in.</p>
                <h3>Are you licensed to do this?</h3>
                <p>Yes. I have been licensed to do hair for 21 years. Some states require special licensing to provide mobile services but Virginia does not. I have a business license and that is all that is required.</p>
                <h3>How do you wash the color out of my hair?</h3>
                <p>All hair is washed in the sink using a spray nozzle. Old school style, the way your grandma used to wash her hair as a kid… In the kitchen sink! It’s effective and fast.</p>
                <h3>How do I know your tools are sanitized between each client?</h3>
                <p>I bring sanitizer solution to your home and sanitize each implement in front of you before I use it. Each client gets a fresh set of towels and a cake. I do not reuse these on clients, they all get washed at the end of the day.</p>
                <h3> How do you take payment?</h3>
                <p>I accept PayPal, Venmo, Zell, Apple Pay, cash or check.</p>
                <h3>Will you come to my house for any service?</h3>
                <p>I have a $50 minimum per visit.</p>
