            <p>Under the "Latest News" heading, we see a bunch of objects such as an image, date, and text, all bunched together. These show a correlation between each chunk of information and say "Hey! this image and text are related to each other!". There is more space in between each section of information, signaling which images and text belong to which story.</p>

            <p>This website uses repetition in the way that it includes the "Order Online" button. Just in this screenshot alone, there are 3 instances where we see the bright red button with white text that reads: "Order Online". The repetition makes it almost impossible to miss what the website is telling the consumers to do.</p>

            <p>This website uses alignment in the way that it is structured. Whether horizontal or vertical, all six of the information blocks are aligned to fit together. They fit in a two column/three row setup, and all the text is left-aligned as well.</p>
